# final_project_may2023

This is a final project for a course from my graduate studies in data science
The goal is to create a recommendation system to best predict what users will rate a business. 
The data is from a site where users create accounts and review businesses based on their experience there.

Below is a google drive link to the data folder that was too big to upload onto github
